# UnityOSCToolkit
Unity client implementation for the NatNet2OSCBridge. Supports Rigidbodies &amp; Skeletons (specifically in "Full Skeleton" mode).

This set of code is a refactor of the code built for the VR & Mocap lab run in November of 2016 at the Expertise Centre for Creative Technology at the HKU.

Currently built on Unity 5.5 (but should work fine with any version of Unity 5)
